	<h1>Questions for METR Workshop 12: METR Deployment Part II</h1>
	<p>The twelfth METR workshop will include focus on the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Might METR be a prerequisite for supporting specific C-ITS operations?</li>
		<li>What challenges exist with phasing in the use of METR?</li>
		<li>What is the process for jurisdictions to phase in support of METR?</li>
		<li>Should there be a way for a jurisdiction to initiate a "discovery" mode to crowd-source or otherwise import readings reported from sensor-equipped user systems in the field?</li>
		<li>What protections does METR need to provide to prevent/recover from false regulatory information?</li>
		<li>To what extent is there a need for remote systems (e.g., vehicles departing for a long drive, lawyers, insurance companies, fleet operators) to access METR information?</li>
		<li>What happens to deployments when we need to update the METR standard(s)?</li>
		<li>What types of vehicles (if any) might be required to support METR once a region achieves a certain maturity level?</li>
	</ul>
