	<h1>Questions for METR Workshop 7: Campus Governance</h1>
	<p>The seventh METR workshop will include focus on the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What are the minimum requirements to become an authorized jurisdictional entity that can issue regulations?</li>
		<li>Are there any restrictions on the size of a jurisdiction to participate in METR?</li>
		<li>What is the process for a small campus or town to become authorized to submit regulations?</li>
		<li>Should a METR regulator be allowed to use a proxy (e.g., a small entity asking a larger or specialty entity to manage its regulations)?</li>
		<li>How should campus regulators interact with METR as compared to governmental regulators?</li>
		<li>How do user systems know the territorial boundaries for each jurisdiction?</li>
		<li>What is the process for defining and approving the electronic representation of a jurisdictional boundary (including campuses)?</li>
		<li>What is the METR process associated with handling a jurisdiction being created or being subsumed into another entity?</li>
		<li>What should happen to existing regulations when the jurisdictional entity for a campus or facility changes?</li>
		<li>To what extent does METR need to indicate that a small campus facility (e.g., a shopâ€™s parking area) is not covered by any additional regulations (e.g., as opposed to not supporting METR)?</li>
		<li>What implications on METR components might there be in dealing with a transport facility that straddles or is near a jurisdictional boundary?</li>
		<li>How quickly do jurisdictional changes need to be implemented on end user systems?</li>
	</ul>
