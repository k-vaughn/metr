	<h1>Questions for METR Workshop 6: Vehicle Information Needs</h1>
	<p>The sixth METR workshop will include focus on the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What data does a vehicle need from METR to properly handle a static ODD boundary?</li>
		<li>What is the operational scenario associated with a vehicle approaching a static <div class="tooltip">operational design domain (ODD)<span class="tooltiptext">An ODD defines the set of operating conditions under which a given driving automation system or feature thereof is specifically designed to function</span></div> boundary that limits the vehicle’s operation? </li>
		<li>What additional information needs to be conveyed by METR to enable a vehicle to properly handle a dynamic ODD boundary?</li>
		<li>What is the operational scenario associated with a vehicle encountering a dynamic ODD boundary that limits the vehicle’s operation?</li>
		<li>How should a METR (esp. an automated) vehicle behave in a region with only partial METR support, should this be a part of the ODD definition?</li>
		<li>To what extent does METR need to provide warnings, especially to automated vehicles, that you are approaching an area without METR coverage or with a lower level of conformance? Does METR need to identify adjacent jurisdictions/METR download zones?</li>
		<li>While the goal is clearly to avoid conflicts within METR, what should a user (or user system) do when encountering conflicting METR regulations (e.g., from different levels of jurisdictions)?</li>
		<li>What, if any, attributes (e.g., priority information) need to be conveyed by METR so that users can appropriately process potentially conflicting regulations from different layers of jurisdictions?</li>
	</ul>
