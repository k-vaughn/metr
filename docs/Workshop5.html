	<h1>Questions for METR Workshop 5: Vehicle Operations</h1>
	<p>The fifth METR workshop will include focus on the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Do vehicles need METR to filter operations? (e.g., by vehicle classification)</li>
		<li>What regulations do users need to know for other users? (e.g., what other types of users also are allowed to use this facility?)</li>
		<li>What information does a vehicle need to determine the regulations to which it must conform?</li>
		<li>Does a vehicle need to know the legal definition of road types and usage allowances?</li>
		<li>How detailed should METR information be? (e.g., does METR need to identify the position of each stop sign or just convey what a stop sign looks like)?</li>
		<li>What categories of information should be standardized so that jurisdictions can identify their level of support?</li>
		<li>What information does a vehicle need to determine if it is allowed to operate on a facility?</li>
		<li>To what extent do vehicles need to be able to learn regional conventions for traffic control devices? (e.g., colours of specialized lanes)</li>
		<li>What information do vehicles need from METR to coordinate the recognition of a new traffic control device being installed?</li>
	</ul>
