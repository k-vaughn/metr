	<h1>Questions for METR Workshop 9: Roadwork and Emergency Operations</h1>
	<p>The ninth METR workshop will include focus on the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What assumptions need to be made about the order in which the business of infrastructure management works?</li>
		<li>What regulatory information needs to be conveyed to allow construction vehicles to enter a work zone while banning normal vehicles?</li>
		<li>What special regulatory information needs to be conveyed for traffic lanes that are in the process of being shifted as a part of road works?</li>
		<li>What is the process of implementing weather-related regulations? (e.g., snow warning, snow chains required, road closed, etc.)</li>
		<li>Does METR need to disseminate official notices that are activated by local law enforcement?</li>
		<li>Is there a need to support a local regulator, such as a police officer, imposing an on-the-spot temporary notice, such as redirecting traffic due to an incident?</li>
		<li>Does METR need to accommodate regulations related to compromised infrastructure?</li>
		<li>Does METR need to accommodate regulations for evacuations?</li>
		<li>To what extent should METR accommodate situations when normal regulations do not apply due to special circumstances, such as driving on the wrong side of the freeway during an evacuation scenario, i.e., a higher priority regulation?</li>
		<li>Does METR need to remain operational during a major disaster to support (perhaps automated) emergency response equipment rushing to the scene?</li>
	</ul>
