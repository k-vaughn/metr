	<h1>Questions for METR Workshop 8: Campus Regulations</h1>
	<p>The eighth METR workshop will include focus on the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What is the process for a campus facility to implement its own regulations within METR?</li>
		<li>What is the boundary between METR and mapping systems?</li>
		<li>Do campus regulations need to be validated in any way (legal authority and legality of law)?</li>
		<li>Should METR distinguish between regulations that do not meet normal guidelines? (e.g., speed limit of 17)</li>
		<li>Are there any additional needs to allow METR to better support the adherence to and enforcement of campus regulations?</li>
		<li>Does METR need to support any special considerations for (e.g., on-street) parking regulations, such as those for residents only, decal required, duration limits, or visitor tag?</li>
		<li>What implications are there for regulators issuing parking permits (e.g., is there a need for an electronic parking decal or visitor tag)?</li>
		<li>What special considerations might METR need to support in relation to on-street parking and temporary changes that might be required (e.g., for snow ploughing, construction, etc.)?</li>
		<li>What other issues do we need to consider?</li>
	</ul>
